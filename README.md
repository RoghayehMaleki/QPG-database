This data gives the singly generated standard integral table algebras of ranks $4, 5, 6,$ and $7$ up to a different order and valency depending on each rank.
The following notation has been used in the Existence column in the Markdown Table:

AS: the program constructed a scheme for this parameter set.  So those are realizable as Association schemes.

TA-xHL: table algebra that failed the handshaking lemma, so program could not start.So, they are not realizable.

TA-xIM: table algebra that failed the integral multiplicity condition.

TA-xR: table algebra that is not realizable by the classification or because it fails some other feasibility condition.

O:  table algebra that passes the feasibility conditions and the realizability is still open.

F: when the code tries to check if the given example is an association scheme or no, but it stops at some value > 0.
